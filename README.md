# Coworking Space Site
## What is it? 
It's a website that showcases the best coworking spaces for lazy devs. The content it's not important, the website only was created to practice CSS.
This is the eleventh project of the Scrimba course, that I uploaded to Github. This project is part of Module 4, where they teach you essential CSS concepts. 
## What did I use?
I used HTML and CSS
## CSS concepts learned for this project and practiced during it
  - Use of `margin:auto` in flex items to arrange them in the container
  - Use of `align-self` to to the same as margin, but only for the cross-axis (vertical in flex-direction:row, horizontal in :column)
  - `position:absolute` to move elements in the dom freely, out of the document arrangement.
  - `position:fixed` the same as absolute, but the element follow de scrollbar, or in other words, stick with the window
  - `z-index` to move positioned objects below or over others.
